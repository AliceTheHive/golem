## How to use

### With the CLI

You can run it like this:
```shell script
python3 cli.py -p ./test_app -t py -n golem_test_app
```
And your application will be generated in the path of your project in the directory : `./dist/`.

This is the usage
```shell script
usage: cli.py [-h] -p PATH -t TYPE [-n NAME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH, --path PATH  The path of the code/project.

### With the GUI

You can run it like this:
```shell script
python3 gui.py
```
After following steps in the GUI, your application will be generated in the path of your project in the directory : `./dist/`.

Note: The GUI is based on tkinter, make sure to have it installed in your python env, in most case it came directly when installing python.
